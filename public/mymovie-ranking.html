<h2>My 3 favorite movies, presented for you.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in the West</h3>
<p>The acting, cinematography, setting and story all combine to give a snapshot of American history.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Fantastic all around. A must see!</p>
<h3>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</h3>
<p>I'm talking about the original here. My choice is partly borne of nostalgia, but I was taken in by this movie.</p>
